Snake Game Project
A classic Snake game built in Java, developed as a collaborative group project.

Project Description
This is a graphical implementation of the classic Snake game. The player controls a snake, guiding it around the playfield to eat food. Each time the snake eats a piece of food, it grows longer. The game ends if the snake collides with the walls or with its own body.
